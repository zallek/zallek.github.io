Hi, I am Nicolas, a web developper.

I've create this blog to share with you some thoughts, problems and ideas about what I'm working on. I'm currently working at [Botify](www.botify.com), as a Front End Javascript developper. So there will be posts about what we do at Botify to develop and improve its SaaS application but also about expirements I'm working on side projects. 

I'm pationnate about the web and how it allows people to build from scratch things that may be use by everybody or every company around the world to make its life easier and maybe a bit better. The web brings new problematics like scalabilibity, internationnalization, extended social networks, and so much more.

I hope that in an early future, you find something interesting to read here and maybe debate about it; because we, web players, might don't have the same idea about how we should build the technologies that power the web, how we should use them and how we should work to create stuff and business.
