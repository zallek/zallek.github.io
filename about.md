Hi, I am Nicolas, a web developer.

I've created this blog to share with you some thoughts, problems and ideas about what I'm working on.

I'm passionate about the web and how it allows people to build from scratch things that may be used by everybody or every company around the world to make its life easier and maybe a bit better. The web brings new problematics like scalability, internationalization, extended social networks, and so much more.

I like to think about how we are developing things, how we could do it better, and a more maintainable and reliable way. I like to read about how other people are solving problems and questions I have, trying to stay open minded, because things change every day, and good ideas come from everywhere, even from differents fields of science.

I'm currently working at Botify, Paris, as a Front End Javascript developer. We make our best to develop the perfect SEO analytic tool. My job isn't only about developing the SaaS web application but also about wondering what data is displayed, how is it displayed, how could we display it in a better way and what could we add to make it better for our users.
